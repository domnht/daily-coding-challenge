# Decimal to Binary
*October 2, 2025*

Given a non-negative integer, return its binary representation as a string.

A binary number uses only the digits `0` and `1` to represent any number. To convert a decimal number to binary, repeatedly divide the number by `2` and record the remainder. Repeat until the number is zero. Read the remainders last recorded to first. For example, to convert `12` to binary:

```
12 รท 2 = 6 remainder 0
6 รท 2 = 3 remainder 0
3 รท 2 = 1 remainder 1
1 รท 2 = 0 remainder 1
```

`12` in binary is `1100`.

## Tests

1. `to_binary(5)` should return `"101"`.
2. `to_binary(12)` should return `"1100"`.
3. `to_binary(50)` should return `"110010"`.
4. `to_binary(99)` should return `"1100011"`.

## Solution

```python
def to_binary(decimal: int) -> str:
    binary_result = ""
    current_quotient = decimal
    while current_quotient != 0:
        current_remainder = current_quotient % 2
        current_quotient = int(current_quotient / 2)
        binary_result = str(current_remainder) + binary_result
    return binary_result
```
